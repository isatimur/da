## Posts Status
Currently we have metadata (title, excerpt, category) for all posts in all languages, but we need to:
1. Complete all translations in data.ts (currently 6 posts per language, need 29)
2. Create page.tsx and layout.tsx files for key posts that mention the Chrome extension

## Key Posts Mentioning Extension (Priority)
- ✅ morning-affirmations-transform-your-day
- ⏳ how-to-write-powerful-affirmations

## Next Steps
Continue adding all 23 remaining posts to each language section in data.ts, then create multilingual pages for key posts.
